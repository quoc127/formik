e.preventDefault()
The list component example is taken from this tutorial about state management in React which uses React hooks. It demonstrates how to add an item to a list by using a form element with input and button elements. In this case, a preventDefault is called on the event when submitting the form to prevent a browser reload/refresh. You can try the code yourself with and without the "prevent default".
